# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
## Step 1
Define a function.
## Step 2
Get the two numbers from the user.
## Step 3
Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.
## Step 
Use for() and if() loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.

## Program:
```
/*
#Program to find the gcd of two number using function.
#Developed by: Vanitha S
#Register number: 212222100057
def gcd():
    num1=int(input())
    num2=int(input())
    if num1<num2:
        smaller=num1
    else:
        smaller=num2
    for i in range(1,smaller+1):
        if num1%i==0 and num2%i==0:
            gcdvalue=i
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",gcdvalue)
*/
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the GCD of two numbers is written and verified using python programming.
